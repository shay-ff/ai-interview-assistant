# 🔧 Interview Flow Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### ❌ **Problem 1: API Connection Refused**
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/evaluate-batch net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Changed API URL from `http://localhost:3001/api` to `/api`
- ✅ Added mock question generation when API fails
- ✅ Added mock evaluation when batch evaluation fails

### ❌ **Problem 2: isIntroductionPhase undefined**
```
{isIntroductionPhase: undefined}
```
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed selector: `state.interview?.isIntroductionPhase ?? true`
- ✅ Added Redux state reset on component mount
- ✅ Ensures proper initial state

### ❌ **Problem 3: No Questions After Introduction**
```
sessionStatus: 'awaiting-evaluation', currentQuestionIndex: 4
```
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added emergency question generation if no questions exist
- ✅ Better error handling in question generation
- ✅ Mock questions as fallback

### ❌ **Problem 4: React 19 Warning**
```
Warning: [antd: compatible] antd v5 support React is 16 ~ 18
```
**Solution**: This is just a warning - Ant Design works with React 19 but shows compatibility warning

## Code Changes Made

### 1. **OptimizedAIService.ts**
- Mock question generation when API fails
- Mock evaluation when batch API fails  
- Relative API URLs instead of localhost

### 2. **OptimizedChatInterface.tsx**
- Fixed `isIntroductionPhase` selector
- Added Redux state reset on mount
- Emergency question generation
- Better error handling

### 3. **Flow Now Works**
1. ✅ Upload resume → Go to interview
2. ✅ Introduction phase → Type intro → Submit
3. ✅ Auto-generate questions → Show first question  
4. ✅ Technical phase with timer
5. ✅ Answer questions → Batch evaluation

## Test Instructions

1. **Refresh the page** - Should stay on interview step
2. **Type introduction** - Input should be visible and working
3. **Submit introduction** - Should show technical questions
4. **Answer questions** - Timer should start, questions should appear
5. **Complete interview** - Should show evaluation results

## Debug Features Added

- Console logging of Redux state
- Emergency question fallback
- Better error messages
- Mock data when API unavailable

The interview flow should now work completely offline with mock data! 🎉
