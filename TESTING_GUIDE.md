# 🧪 Quick Test Guide for Groq AI Integration

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### 1. **Basic Setup Test**
```bash
# 1. Check if server is running
npm run dev
# Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"

# 2. Open in browser - should load without errors

cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add: VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key-here

# 2. Restart server
npm run dev
```

**Enhanced Test Flow:**

```

### 6. **Error Handling Test**
